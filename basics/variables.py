# When you develop a program, you need to manage values, a lot of them. To store values, you use variables.
#
# In Python, a variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. And a variable is always associated with a value. For example:

message = "selladurai rajan"
print(message)

message2="janaki anandakumar"
print(message2)
